Compile program with
gcc wframe3.c -O3 -fopenmp -lnuma

If you donÂ´t have numa support then remove -lnuma and also in wframe3.c the 
include file "numa.h" and first five lines in main() (only relevant to numa).

To set up which files to use edit the file data_files. It should contain the following

On line i:
1: Number of graphs
2: Number of times each graph is run, only best running time will be reported
3: Number of parallel configurations followed by threads in Conf1 Conf2 ConfN. For sequential runs set number
of configurations to 0
4- Names of data files, one line per file

Any lines after this will be ignored.

run with

./a.out data_files

To specify which algorithms to run edit wframe3.c and set the associated boolean values to true or false:

SortEdgesSequential          Sort the edges, needed for Greedy and GPA
WGreedyVertex                Standard Greedy algorithm, assumes the edge list has been sorted
WSuitorSequential            Standard sequential suitor algorithm
WRama,WRoma                  Turns on Rama and Roma post-processing, note that this is not available for all algorithms
WGPASequential               Sequential Global paths algorithm, assumes the edge list has been sorted
WLocalMaxSequential          Sequential Local max algorithm
WPGASequential               Sequential path growing algorithm with ensuing dynamic programming, does not work with Roma/Rama.
W2RSuitorDPCycSequential     Sequential M1M2 algorithm
WSuitorParallel              Parallel suitor algorithm
WLocalMaxLocalListParallel   Parallel Local max algorithm, uses one queue for each thread
W2RSuitorDPParallel          Parallel M1M2 algorithm

See the file results.m for output. This can be read into Matlab and used for analyzing and
plotting the results.
